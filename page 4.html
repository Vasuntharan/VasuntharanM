    <h1>What is the mouth?</h1><br>Your mouth is an oval-shaped opening that sits just below your nose. It starts at your lips and ends towards your tonsils. Your mouth is part of your digestive system and respiratory system.<br>Other names for your mouth include oral cavity.<br><h2>Mouth function in digestive system</h2><br>Your mouth is where digestion begins. When you chew food, your salivary glands make saliva (spit). Saliva helps break down starches in the foods you eat. Then your tongue moves the food into your throat, down through your esophagus and into your stomach.<br>Mouth function in respiratory system<br>Like your nose, your mouth brings air into your lungs. Since your mouth is larger than your nose, it brings in more air. And because the air doesn’t have to travel as far, your body can use it faster.<br>But unlike your nose, your mouth doesn’t have a filtration system. When you breathe through your nose, it filters, warms and moistens it. Tiny hairs (cilia) sweep mucus into the back of your throat where you swallow it, and then your stomach neutralizes it. Breathing mainly through your mouth (mouth breathing) can dry out your gums and cause issues like bad breath and dry mouth.<br>
